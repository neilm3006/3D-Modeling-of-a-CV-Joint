# 3D-Modeling-of-a-CV-Joint
I completed a hands-on project where I designed, modelled, and 3D printed a Constant Velocity (CV) joint using Fusion 360. This involved taking apart an actual CV joint, examining the separate parts, taking precise measurements, translating those into a detailed 3D model, and finally reassembling the CV joint. The project deepened my understanding of mechanical design, CAD software, and the practical applications of 3D printing in prototyping and manufacturing. Through this process, I honed my skills in problem-solving, iterative design, and technical precision, culminating in a functional 3D-printed prototype.
